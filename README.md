# Object_detection_and_Counting

## Overview
This project implements an object detection and counting system using deep learning techniques. The system detects various objects in images or video frames and counts their occurrences in real-time or batch processing.

## Features
- Detect multiple object classes using a pre-trained model (e.g., YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN).
- Count the number of detected objects in images or videos.
- Visualize detection results with bounding boxes and labels.
- Support for video stream processing for real-time applications.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the model used)
- NumPy
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DetectNCount.git
   cd DetectNCount
